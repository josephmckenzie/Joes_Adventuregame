# Joe's_Adventure_game
My First Crack At A Text Based Choose Your Own Adventure Game.
I have just started to learn the ruby programming language a few weeks ago from a cpl real cool people that are 
teaching a class of us here in a small SW Pennsylvania coal mining town..... I am sure I will  look back on these 
first game files , I have however been playing with this for little while so I won't have the very start of me working
on it unfortunately, but as of when I first started on github everything will be...

If you see something that would work better for me or that I totally messed up let me know.....
There are a few errors that ive come across that i need to figure out where in my coding its doing it.
I WILL figure it out one way or another though.....

Thanks and have a wonderful day...... 
Feel free to contact me with any questions,suggestions or anything really.....
Just no spam please....  :)

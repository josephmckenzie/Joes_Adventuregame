# Joes_Adventuregame
My First crack at a choose your own adventure game

I hvae just started to learn the ruby programming language a few eeks ago from a cpl cool people that are teaching a class of us here in small swPennslyviania ...... I am sure i will look back on these first game files , I have however been laying with this for little while so i wont have every instance of me changing something up here.....

If you see something that would work better for me or that i totaly messed up let me know. There are a few errors that ive come across that i need to figure out where in my coding its doing it.... I will figure it out one way or another though :)
